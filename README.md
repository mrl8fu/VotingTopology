A note on the CSV files:

"Numbered" files means that all county and independent city names are replaced with unique integer identifiers, numbered 1-135.

After the 2000 election, Clifton Forge City is no longer recognized as an independent city, and rather is incorporated in Alleghany County, and as such its identifer (135) is no longer present in any following elections.

After the 2012 election, Bedford City is no longer recognized as an independent city, and rather is incorporated in Bedford County, and as such its identifier (134) is not present in any following elections.
